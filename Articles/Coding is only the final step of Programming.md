# Leslie Lamport: Programming ≠ Coding

## Key Insights
- **Programming ≠ Coding**: Coding is only the final step; programming starts with defining goals and methods.
- **Importance of Mathematical Methods**: Simple mathematics is the best tool for problem-solving, yet many programmers do not know how to use it.
- **Real-World Applications**: The lecture will provide examples of how these methods are applied in actual software development.

-Coding is the last step in writing a program. The first step is deciding what we want to achieve and how. The best methods for working through subsequent steps consist in using simple mathematics. Few programmers know how to do this or where to learn it. This lecture will use various examples to show how this is done, and how these methods are implemented in real software.

When you use a computer, you use algorithms developed by Leslie Lamport. Winner of the 2013 Turing Award (considered the "Nobel Prize of computer science"), he is renowned for solving practical problems in the computer industry by mathematically creating frameworks for distributed systems and concurrent programming. He is also famous as the author of the LaTeX document formatting language, a dialect of TeX which has become the standard of publishing in the mathematical sciences.
